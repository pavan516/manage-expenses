        <h6><b>11. Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)</b></h6>
        <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.</p>
        <p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>
        <p>0.1. users can visit our site anonymously;</p>
        <p>0.2. our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the home page of our website;</p>
        <p>0.3. users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;</p>
        <p>0.4. users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at <b>en.pavankumar@gmail.com</b>.</p>
        <p>Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:</p>
        <p>We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.</p>
        <p>You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.</p>
